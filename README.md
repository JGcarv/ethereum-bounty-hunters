# Ethereum Bounty Hunters

Repository dedicated to listing current bug bounty programs in the Ethereum ecosystem. 

Since bug bounties became quite popular, this repo aims to makes easier for both projects and hunters. Developers can easily find new programs to work on and projects have access to more eyes to review their code. It's a win-win.

Bounties are posted as issues with basic information and they keep open as long as the reward program is running. Use the labels to filter for bounties that match your criteria.
